   </div>
	   <p>A cognitive radio is a radio that can be programmed and configured dynamically to use the best wireless channels
		   in its vicinity to avoid user interference and congestion. Such a radio automatically detects available channels 
		   in wireless spectrum, then accordingly changes its transmission or reception parameters to allow more concurrent 
		   wireless communications in a given spectrum band at one location. This project's aim was to develop a mechanism to improve 
		   the performance of Cognitive radios. Superior Selective Reporting (SSR) is a hybrid of cooperative spectrum sensing
		   and local sensing. Simulation outcomes proved that SSR increases detection probability of primary user transmission 
		   by 35% and mitigates interference to primary users.</p>

	   <p><font size="3"><b>LITERATURE REVIEW</b></p>
	   <p>Cognitive radio networking coupled with spectrum sensing technology enables unlicensed secondary users (SUs)
		   to opportunistically access the licensed spectrum of primary users (PUs). Cooperative spectrum sensing 
		   significantly improves the detection probability of primary user transmission. Nevertheless, current 
		   cooperative sensing techniques render shortcomings including energy consumption and overhead in sensing phase. 
		   Overheads are a consequence of multiple cooperative SUs reporting their decision to the fusion center.</p>
		 
	   <p><font size="3"><b>COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS</b></p>
	   <p>After reviewing research papers, I brainstormed ideas in collaboration with my supervisor.
		   We came up with a hybrid scheme of cooperative spectrum sensing and local sensing which gives 
		   higher detection probability, lower missed detection rate and lesser detection overhead as opposed 
		   to the traditional cooperative sensing methods</p>

	   <p><font size="3"><b>PROGRAMMING</b></p>
	   <p>I implemented a new scheme, Superior Selective Reporting, and test its effectiveness. 
		   Plots from simulations in MATLAB gave encouraging results. Furthermore, I explored  Bayesian detector
		   in place of previously used energy detector method for spectrum sensing. </p>
