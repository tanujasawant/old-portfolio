<p>Most advertisement posters today mention links to websites as text or QR codes. This form of passive interaction
does not provide enough incentive to the user to visit the mentioned website. A seamlessly integrated, novel Augmented
	Reality experience can be a motivating factor for the users, also providing more information about the advertised product / 
	service. </p>
	
	<p> Smart Poster is an Android App based on Augmented Reality. With Smart Poster, users can point their phone cameras 
and see the posters come alive with 3D interactive models. This Android app redirects users to a third-party website 
via the NFC tag/QR code displayed on it. Interaction introduces another dimension that enables users to get
acquainted with the productâ€™s specifics. Companies can keep track of number of visits to their website, 
or number of AR object accesses, through the third-party website.</p>

	   <p><font size="3"><b>IDEATION</b></p>
	 <p>In this phase, I mapped the product's working:After scanning NFC tag/QR code, the application starts the 
		   device camera. The 3D model's object file is downloaded from the third-party website database, following which
		   an AR object is seen on a given base image called tracker. For the purpose of code reusability, automation, and
		   database maintenance, a third-party website was created. Every client can host multiple URLs and objects. The QR
		   code for each of these is autogenerated on the third party website. The number of accesses by customers are logged
		   in the database.</p>

	   <p><font size="3"><b>PROGRAMMING</b></p>
	   <p>  Vuforia was used as the AR platform to incorporate a tracker on which the 3D model pops up.
		   Zxing library in Unity was used to scan QR codes. The android app was partly built with Android SDK and partly with Unity.</p>
	    
	   <p><font size="3"><b>TESTING</b></p>
		<p>After conducting a study with 10 participants, we found that users were more interested in the advertised product 
			when they used Smart Poster app. Smart Poster can also increase the number of website views for the company.</p>

	   <p><font size="3"><b>REFLECTIONS</b></p>
	   <p>This project was a great opportunity to explore the applications of Augmented Reality. I learnt to develop interfaces 
		   and making them user-friendly. I got to work on Unity and Android Studio which I find helpful to refer back in my work.
		  I learnt to actively be on the lookout for ideas, because many manual tasks can be simplified through HCI.</p>
	   
	   <p>I learnt a lot from my mentor and other project students, who always had new IOT applications to discuss.
