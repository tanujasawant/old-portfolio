	   <p>Smart Poster is an Android App that redirects users to a third-party website on scanning of NFC tag/QR code 
		   from the company product’s advertisement poster. While normal posters usually display an item’s picture,
		   Smart Poster allows users to interact with the product’s 3D AR object that pops up after website 
		   redirection to the company’s website. Interaction introduces another dimension that enables users to get
		   acquainted with the product’s specifics. Companies can keep track of number of visits to their website, 
		   or number of AR object accesses, through the third-party website.</p>

		   <p>The sense of touch has been shown to trigger emotional attachment and to communicate physical connection. Social touch 
can be defined as touch occuring between individuals in a co-located space. Social Touch Technology is the use of haptic 
technology for augmenting experiences of social touch. This is underexplored in interactive systems which mostly rely on 
audio and visual modalities. The goal of this project was to develop a novel human-machine interaction technique and to 
			   design a user experiment to test its effectiveness.</p>
	   <p>RESEARCH QUESTION: How is emotional perception affected when vibrotactile touch patterns are combined with the thermal
		   modality?</p>
	
	   <p><font size="3"><b>HARDWARE PROTOTYPING</b></p>
	   <p>Each Tactibit has a coin-shaped vibration motor to simulate vibration, a peltier to simulate the temperature of touch) an 
h-bridge to drive direction of current, and an ATtiny84 microcontroller to control all these components. I2C communication 
was setup between an Arduino as a master and ATtiny as slaves.

	   <p><font size="3"><b>EXPERIMENT DESIGN</b></p>
		   <p>I developed a software and user interface on Unity to test Tactibits on 12 participants. Three patterns, stroke, poke and hit 
were simulated..The independent variables were temperature,(hot, cold or room temperature) and vibration. 
The dependent variables were valence and arousal ratings of participants on a 7-point Likert scale. Through the software, one can 
set the temperature and vibration values, and customize touch patterns. Tactibits can be arranged to form any types of patterns.</p>

  	<div class="desc">Participants answer these questions after every trial of 
	patterns is played.on the forearm. There are 18 trials per 
	participant.</div>

	    <p><font size="3"><b>APPLICATIONS</b></p>
	   <p>Tactibits can serve to enhance user experience, convey affective information, strengthen sense of presence, etc, They also oofer a 
promising way of providing empathetic interfaces health assistive technologies. When placed on the back of mobile phones, Tactibits 
can be used to introduce touch as a medium of communication when people talk on the phone. Tactibits could also be used to study 
how different parts of the human body perceives simulated touch patterns.</p>
