	   <p>Smart Poster is an Android App that redirects users to a third-party website on scanning of NFC tag/QR code 
		   from the company product’s advertisement poster. While normal posters usually display an item’s picture,
		   Smart Poster allows users to interact with the product’s 3D AR object that pops up after website 
		   redirection to the company’s website. Interaction introduces another dimension that enables users to get
		   acquainted with the product’s specifics. Companies can keep track of number of visits to their website, 
		   or number of AR object accesses, through the third-party website.</p>

	   <p><font size="3"><b>IDEATION</b></p>
	 <p>The working of the product to be built was decided: After scanning the NFC tag/QR code, the application starts the 
		   camera of the device. An object file from the client company is downloaded from the third-party website database.
		   A 3D AR object is seen on a given base image called tracker. For the purpose of code reusability, automation, and
		   database maintenance, a third-party website was created. Every client can host multiple URLs and objects. The QR
		   code for each of these is autogenerated on the third party website. The number of accesses by customers are logged
		   in the database.</p>

	   <p><font size="3"><b>PROGRAMMING</b></p>
	   <p> The AR platform, Vuforia was used to incorporate a tracker on which the 3D model pops up.
		   Zxing library in Unity was used to scan QR codes. The android app was partly built with Android SDK and partly with Unity.</p>
	    
	   <p><font size="3"><b>TESTING</b></p>
		<p>After conducting a study with 10 participants, we found that users were more interested in the advertised product 
			when they used Smart Poster app. Smart Poster can also increase the number of website views for the company.</p>
