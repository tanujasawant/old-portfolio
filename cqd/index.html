	   <p><font size="3"><b>WHAT ARE QUANTUM DOTS?</b></p>
    
	     <p>Quantum Dots are nanoparticles that emit light when electricity or light falls on them. For this project, I led a
		     group of three members to synthesize and study properties of Carbon and Graphene Quantum dots. 
		     I was responsible for poster design. Our team won the best poster award at the ThinkNano Symposium 2016, Indian Institute of Science</p>

	   <p><font size="3"><b>COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS</b></p>
	   <p>I looked into the related works in the area of Social Touch Technology. I analyzed each of these works and brainstormed 
ideas for my research project.</p>

	   <p><font size="3"><b>HARDWARE PROTOTYPING</b></p>
	   <p>Each Tactibit has a coin-shaped vibration motor to simulate vibration, a peltier to simulate the temperature of touch) an 
h-bridge to drive direction of current, and an ATtiny84 microcontroller to control all these components. I2C communication 
was setup between an Arduino as a master and ATtiny as slaves.

	   <p><font size="3"><b>EXPERIMENT DESIGN</b></p>
		   <p>I developed a software and user interface on Unity to test Tactibits on 12 participants. Three patterns, stroke, poke and hit 
were simulated..The independent variables were temperature,(hot, cold or room temperature) and vibration. 
The dependent variables were valence and arousal ratings of participants on a 7-point Likert scale. Through the software, one can 
set the temperature and vibration values, and customize touch patterns. Tactibits can be arranged to form any types of patterns. 
Participants answer the following questions after every trial of patterns is played.on the forearm. There are 18 trials per 
	participant.</p>

	   <p><font size="3"><b>APPLICATIONS</b></p>
	   <p>Tactibits can serve to enhance user experience, convey affective information, strengthen sense of presence, etc, They also oofer a 
promising way of providing empathetic interfaces health assistive technologies. When placed on the back of mobile phones, Tactibits 
can be used to introduce touch as a medium of communication when people talk on the phone. Tactibits could also be used to study 
how different parts of the human body perceives simulated touch patterns.</p>
	   <p>Owing to the small duration of my internship, I could not conduct the user experiment. However, this project will be 
		   continued further by my supervisors.   </p>
