	   <p>Quantum Dots are nanoparticles that emit light when electricity or light falls on them. The frequency of light and thus
		   the colour emitted by an excited quantum dot depends inversely on the size of the particle. For this project, I led a group of three members to synthesize and study properties of Carbon and Graphene Quantum dots. 
		     I was also responsible for poster design. Our team won the best poster award at the ThinkNano Symposium 2016, Indian Institute of Science</p>

	   <p>The carbon quantum dots were synthesized by hydrothermal treatment of 0.8g Urea and 1g Ascorbic acid with 
		   appropriate amount of distilled water as solvent. The mixture was heated at 1500 C in a Teflonlined stainlesssteel
		   autoclave for a period of 5 hours and subsequently allowed to cool naturally.</p>
<p>Graphene Quantum Dots (GQD) were synthesized by boiling a mixture of 1g glucose and 100 Î¼l ammonia at 100 0 C until a yellowbrown
	colour was observed. The CQDs and GQDs thus obtained were studied with a Spectrofluorometer.</p>
		   <p>The plots below depict observations from the study. It was found that wavelength corresponding to peak 
			   intensity is independent of excitation wavelength in case of Carbon Quantum Dots but dependent on 
			   excitation wavelength for Graphene Quantum Dots. Additionally, these quantum dots
	   were studied using a cyclic voltammetry device.</p>

	   <p><font size="3"><b>POSTER DESIGN</b></p>
	   <p>I designed the poster using Adobe Photoshop. The concepts and applications of quantum dots have been explained
		   on the poster. A demonstration of methods of synthesis and study was given during the poster presentation.</p>

	   <p><font size="3"><b>SYMPOSIUM PRESENTATION</b></p>
	   <p>Our audience received the presentation well as the poster was not cluttered with too many technical details. 
		   The audience was able to comprehend the subject better than other poster presentations because we chose to 
		   deliver the technical details through a demonstration. Adopting this technique won us the first prize!</p>
