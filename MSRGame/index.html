   </div>

	  
	   <p>Spatial Audio can be defined as a 3D audio experience created using headphones. Since people with visual impairments have a 
heightened auditory sense when compared to the general sighted population, spatial audio technology is a useful tool for 
improving accessibility.</p>

<p>This project is a subproject of AVARE (Augmented Virtual And Real Environments) which has the goal of 
empowering VIPs (Visually Impaired Persons) to experience rich multi-modal interactions in everyday activities ranging from work and social interactions
to entertainment and exploration, while remaining affordable in emerging markets. </p>

<p>ReSAC (Responsive Spatial Audio Cloud) is a technology for intuitively describing the world in audio form to a VIP. ReSAC aids 
in a user’s iterative exploration of new environments by verbalizing details (objects, people, aesthetics) as a spatialized “cloud”
of words and sounds. </p>

<p>At Microsoft Research, my team and I are developing software to test ReSAC in virtual and mixed reality environments. 
We are also conducting user studies with blind and blind-folded participants to test the effectiveness of ReSAC. The process comprises of literature review, user studies, need-finding, and removing barriers 
to gaming experiences of the vision-impaired. </p>

<p>I am involved in developing the software and conducting user studies on an iterative basis. </p>

	   <p><font size="3"><b>COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS</b></p>
	   <p>I looked into the related works in the area of Accessibility for people with vision impairments. 
		   I analyzed each of these works to design and conduct efficient user studies. Selected pieces of literature review are mentioned below. </p>

	   <p><font size="3"><b>APPLICATIONS</b></p>
	   <p>The estimated number of people with vision impairments in the world is 285 million. Use of ReSAC would enable these
	   individuals to navigate in open physical, virtual and mixed-reality environments without any supervision or 
	   external help. Additionally, ReSAC can help VIPs to learn new environments better and faster by forming better 
		   cognitive maps.</p>

	   <p><font size="3"><b>LITERATURE REVIEW</b></p>
		   <p>The sense of touch has been shown to trigger emotional attachment and to communicate physical connection. Social touch 
can be defined as touch occuring between individuals in a co-located space. Social Touch Technology is the use of haptic 
technology for augmenting experiences of social touch. This is underexplored in interactive systems which mostly rely on 
audio and visual modalities. The goal of this project was to develop a novel human-machine interaction technique and to 
			   design a user experiment to test its effectiveness.</p>
	   <p>RESEARCH QUESTION: How is emotional perception affected when vibrotactile touch patterns are combined with the thermal
		   modality?</p>
	 <p><font size="3"><b>COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS</b></p>
	   <p>I looked into the related works in the area of Social Touch Technology. I analyzed each of these works and brainstormed 
ideas for my research project.</p>

	   <p><font size="3"><b>HARDWARE PROTOTYPING</b></p>
	   <p>Each Tactibit has a coin-shaped vibration motor to simulate vibration, a peltier to simulate the temperature of touch, an 
h-bridge to drive direction of current, and an ATtiny84 microcontroller to control all these components. I2C communication 
was setup between an Arduino as a master and ATtiny as slaves.

	   <p><font size="3"><b>EXPERIMENT DESIGN</b></p>
		   <p>I developed a software and user interface on Unity to test Tactibits on 12 participants. Three patterns, stroke, poke and hit 
were simulated. The independent variables were temperature,(hot, cold or room temperature) and vibration. 
The dependent variables were valence and arousal ratings of participants on a 7-point Likert scale. Through the software, one can 
set the temperature and vibration values, and customize touch patterns. Tactibits can be arranged to form any types of patterns. 
Participants answer the following questions after every trial of patterns is played.on the forearm. There are 18 trials per 
	participant.</p>

	   <p><font size="3"><b>APPLICATIONS</b></p>
	   <p>Tactibits can serve to enhance user experience, convey affective information, strengthen sense of presence, etc, They also offer a 
promising way of providing empathetic interfaces to health assistive technologies. When placed on the back of mobile phones, Tactibits 
can be used to introduce touch as a medium of communication when people talk on the phone. Tactibits could also be used to study 
how different parts of the human body perceive simulated touch patterns.</p>
	   <p>Owing to the small duration of my internship, I could not conduct the user experiment. However, this project will be 
		   continued further by my supervisors.   </p>
	 
	   <p><font size="3"><b>REFLECTIONS</b></p>
	   <p>I experienced the life of an HCI researcher through this project. I learnt advanced ATtiny and Arduino prototyping, Unity
		   and designing user experiments. I became acquainted with new research methodologies, learnt to work in diverse teams and developed a habit of actively noting down project ideas and implementing them in my free time.
		  </p>
	   
	   <p>I was guided by amazing mentors, who taught me a great deal about the HCI community, as well as designing and building
	great products. They helped me master the right methods of literature review and prototyping.
		   I was given a PhD opportunity at Telecom ParisTech towards the completion of my internship.  </p>
